## Introduction and motivation
------------------------------


This month I started a course @ HackBulgaria... a NodeJS course.
Now a bit background on HackBulgaria... brace yourselves here comes advertisements:

* Fairly new organisation created by @RadoRado ( Founder of HackFMI, which is another initiative that you need to atleast google before you continue reading)

* Provides free courses in the opensource mistique fields

* Practices the "reverse classroom teaching"

For those interested here's a link to the site: www.hackbulgaria.com .... yada yada yada

Now continuing... so it wasn't long after (actually on the second lecture) that I got to create something cool. "What was it?" you ask. Well a routing engine... A freakin' routing engine in Node. More on that in Wiki(add description link). To be honest, it was fairly
straight forward given the mutable nature of JavaScript and NodeJS as a technology on which to build on. How was the router inspired.
We were given a task to create a server that had the functionality of ExpressJS (description link) built on Node.

What I started thinking... I didn't want to just create yet another utility and not give it somekind of personality.
